This is a program that will run a telnet server on your computer and run a program when it receives the string "execute" followed by an enter (which should be a "\r\n" on your arduino).

1) Download that file to you computer and save it somewhere on your hard drive. Your user directory would probably be best.
2) Figure out the path to the program you want to execute. In this example we'll use ~/script.sh
3) Ensure you have java installed, but I believe it should be installed on Macs by default
4) Navigate to the directory that you downloaded telnet.jar to
5) Run the command:     java -jar telnet.jar ~/script.sh         replacing "~/script.sh" with the path to your executable
6) Connect with telnet through the arduino to your computer on port 6666
7) Send the "execute" command through your arduino and it should launch the program you specified
